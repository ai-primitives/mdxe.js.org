# Remote Components

MDXE supports importing components from remote URLs.

## Usage

```mdx
import Button from 'https://ui.example.com/button'
import Card from 'https://components.example.com/card'

<Button>Click me</Button>
<Card title="Example">Content</Card>
```

## Security Considerations

1. Only import from trusted sources
2. Use HTTPS URLs
3. Consider implementing CSP headers
4. Cache remote components

## Best Practices

```javascript
// Configure trusted sources
const config = {
  allowedDomains: [
    'ui.example.com',
    'components.example.com'
  ]
}
```
